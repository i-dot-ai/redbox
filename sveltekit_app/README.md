# Sveltekit App

This is looking at using Sveltekit, instead of Django, for rendering and serving the HTML server-side.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Then start the dev server with `npm run dev`

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
