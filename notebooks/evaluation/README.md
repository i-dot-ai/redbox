# üìÆ Redbox RAG evaluation

How can we unlock evaluators of all technical abilities to produce reproducible, sharable, actionable evaluations of Redbox's RAG system?

In this subdirectory, we aim to provide a common workflow so that no matter your department or profession, you can help make Redbox better.

## Overview

The ultimate aim of any RAG evaluation should be an end-to-end (e2e) evaluation of the RAG pipeline. This pipeline covers all combinations and configurations of:

* Chunking
* Embedding
* Retrieval
* Prompts

With such a vast hyperparameter space, the first principle of our evaluation is that:

> [!NOTE]  
> **Data is immutable.** Analysis is done on static, versioned datasets so our insights share a common subject.

We therefore conceptualise evaluation as containing three roles:

* I want to **create a new versioned dataset** for my colleagues to study
* I want to **baseline a new versioned dataset** to create metrics to improve on
* I want to **study a versioned dataset** I've been given to improve Redbox

## üìö Creating a versioned dataset

> [!NOTE]  
> **Create a versioned dataset** with [`rag_create_evaluation_dataset.ipynb`](/notebooks/evaluation/rag_create_evaluation_dataset.ipynb)

The goal of this notebook is to create a filesystem of data ready-made for others to study:

```text
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ evaluation/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {version_number}/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chunks               # the chunked documents of study
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw                  # the raw documents of study
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ results              # results from using this data
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ baseline.csv     # the baseline results
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ synthetic            # Q&A datasets of study created with RAGAS
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings           # pre-embedded document chunks
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {model}.jsonl    # pre-embedded chunks for a single embedding model
```

We use [RAGAS](https://ragas.io) to create synthetic data, but are more than happy for users to manually create datasets too.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Baseline a versioned dataset

> [!NOTE]  
> **Baseline a versioned dataset** with [`rag_baseline_evaluation.ipynb`](/notebooks/evaluation/rag_baseline_evaluation.ipynb)

Benchmarking is a one-off run of a versioned dataset against the production retrieval engine. Sharing the benchmark with the versioned data gives evaluators metrics they can aim to improve.

## üîé Studying a versioned dataset

> [!NOTE]  
> **Study** a versioned dataset with [`rag_experiment_evaluation.ipynb`](/notebooks/evaluation/rag_experiment_evaluation.ipynb)

The goal of this notebook is that everything you need to study a versioned dataset should be contained in a single place that evaluators can run end to end.

We use [DeepEval](https://docs.confident-ai.com) to evaluate datasets.

The versioned dataset should ideally have been **baselined**, providing you with metrics you can aim to improve. Modify the RAG system via the notebook, and express findings in relation to these baseline metrics.

Right now the notebook only contains the final retrieval engine: the interplay of prompts and retriever. Chunking and embedding strategies will need to be loaded outside this notebook, though you can certainly assess them using it.

## ‚úÖ Success! What now?

You've studied a dataset and improved the RAG system. Congratulations! It's time to get those changes into Redbox.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Evaluation doesn't need to be done by engineers.** Raise an issue with your evidence, and we'll implement it.

If you're confident enough to implement it yourself, we absolutely welcome changes as pull requests (PR), but this is by no means a requirement. We believe that great evaluation can come from a plurality of backgrounds. What we care about is your evidence.

### What evidence do I include?

An improved user experience is the heart of an accepted change. You should include the following, but always in service of how user experience is improved:

* The dataset version
* The baseline
* The change to the baseline

Never forget your metrics are just a proxy for user experience. They exist to justify, explain and contextualise changes -- they support your PR, and are never the PR themselves. What problem did updating the dataset seek to measure? How do your changes address this? Why are any drops in other metrics worth it?

* Metrics are always in relation to a baseline, because difficulty changes with the dataset
* As a rule of thumb, metrics moving $\pm 5 \%$ are significant
* Some metrics dropping for other metrics to rise is a tradeoff justified by user experience of the system
* LLMs typically aren't deterministic. Run metrics for your final proposal multiple times, and produce confidence intervals if you can

If you can evidence that your notebook would make for a better experience than production, we can take it from there.

## ‚ùå Failure! What now?

Either as an evaluator or user, you've found a significant problem with the RAG system. Perhaps you're even struggling to explain exactly what's wrong, merely that it's "worse". Here we attempt to provide some clear actions to help refine responses to problems like this.

We believe there's two ways we might fix this in our evaluation loop:

### We need more data!

Perhaps you've seen a document used in Redbox that performs badly, or a certain order of questions produces strange results.

In this case we need to **create a new versioned dataset**. This might contain more source documents that better-cover the problem space, or more nuanced or difficult Q&A scenarios to better-describe user interactions. Either way, we need more data.

### We need better metrics!

Perhaps a user has given a piece of feedback that maps poorly onto our existing metrics. In early versions, for example, some users felt replies were too short.

There are more metrics available for RAG systems than the ones we use, and it's potentially time to add another, or even develop our own. In this case we want to **extend our study of a versioned dataset** to add more appropriate measures of the things users care about.
