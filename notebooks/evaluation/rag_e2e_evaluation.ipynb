Rather they were granted to low-income households irrespective of employment status and the only condition applied to one of the study arms was the requirement to engage in a community- based group.\\\\n\\\\nAgain...\\\\n\\\\nIt is worth noting that, as contrasted with UBI pilots in other High-Income Countries, Finland’s Basic Income experiment was statutory and randomised, significantly increasing confidence in their findings. In addition, all of these findings were found to remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic variables, including gender, age, education, household structure and income.\\\\n\\\\nsignificant improvements in wellbeing among all four groups receiving B-MINCOME payments were observed in comparison with the control group who continued to receive standard benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBarcelona’s B-MINCOME study compared traditional welfare benefits, with the effects of four forms of cash payments, namely\", ' (1) cash payments received on an unlimited basis', ' (2) cash payments received on a limited basis (whereby they were incrementally reduced according to any household earnings in excess of the basic threshold)', ' (3) cash payments received unconditionally', ' and (4) cash payments received conditionally on the basis of involvement in a social programme (Kirchner et al. 2019). Although B-MINCOME had a complex study design,\\\\n\\\\nGeneral satisfaction with life, assessed according to a 10-point Likert scale, increased by 27% amongst B-MINCOME groups as a whole, and at the end of the study the probability of participants reporting a ‘high level of life satisfaction’ (rating their wellbeing as ≥ 7/10) was 11% higher amongst those receiving any form of B-MINCOME payment compared with those in the control group (Kirchner et al. 2019). Self-reported experiences of mental illness were also found to be significantly lower (9.6%), although it is not clear from the study reporting exactly how ‘experiences of mental illness’ were enquired about.

Interviews with participants also found that a renewed sense of hope for the future was ubiquitous among recipients (The Young Foundation, 2019', \" 2020).\\\\n\\\\nThe Netherlands Social Assistance Experiments sought to explore whether changes to social security payments could improve employment rates. As such, a sample of participants who were already in receipt of welfare benefits had their payments changed in one of three ways, with a control group who remained on welfare benefits as usual. In one group all conditionality surrounding social security was removed, in a second group increased help and guidance in finding employment was provided and in a third group recipients were allowed to earn extra money before their social security payments were withdrawn (Verlaat et al. 2020). A survey of all groups conducted at the end of the pilot identified positive treatment effects in terms of subjective wellbeing for all three interventions compared to the control group, although these did not reach statistical significance. However, a statistically significant treatment effect on participant’s self- efficacy (defined as a combined measure of self-confidence and perceived ability to find work) was found among both those who had had the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nsurrounding their benefits removed\\\\n\\\\nhad received additional help in finding employment (0.573, p=0.055) (Verlaat et al. 2020). In addition, in interviews, participants in both of these groups consistently reported increased wellbeing and a reduction in stress and anxiety.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ontario Basic Income Pilot (OBIP) was first launched in 2018, with the aim of providing a fixed income for three years to residents of three communities (Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay). Potential participants were those aged 18 to 64 who were living on low or no income, and data was collected from 4000 individuals receiving payments and 2000 control participants (Mendelson, 2019). Although, all of the tenets of UBI were therefore clearly not met, the pilot did provide a guaranteed, unconditional income equivalent to 75% of the Low-Income Measure (Mendelson, 2019).

Research has shown that variations in the value of UBI-like payments can affect childhood obesity rates, especially when payments vary annually with factors such as oil prices. Additionally, UBI-style payments have been linked to positive impacts on health risk behaviors, including dietary habits and substance misuse. The human and economic costs of health risk behaviors are significant. <Doced708774-780c-4374-af7c-e99df3dea0c4>\\n\\nSources: <Doced708774-780c-4374-af7c-e99df3dea0c4>', expected_output='The probability of obesity in young adults receiving UBI-like payments is reduced by 2-4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income. However, initial household socio-economic status can impact these findings, with an initial increase in BMI observed among children from lower income households.', context=[\"[', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

The exception to this is security\\\\n\\\\n14\\\\n\\\\nguards (as shown by ‘A’ in Figure 1) where potential uses of AI have been documented to be anything from monitoring live video to AI powered patrol bots.22 Whilst lower skilled occupations are generally less exposed to AI, there are still some higher skilled occupations at skill level 3 that are less exposed, such as roofers and sports players (as shown by ‘B’ in Figure 1).\\\\n\\\\nThese results are consistent with the findings of similar research23 which suggests that occupations requiring a lower level of education tend to be more manual and often technically difficult roles, which have already seen extensive changes due to developments in technologies, and it is unlikely to be cost effective to apply further automation.24, 25 Furthermore, more recent advancements in AI have been more applicable to software and technologies and either require skills in technical coding or use of specific software as part of the job, e.g. accountancy and finance.\\\\n\\\\n22 Artificial Intelligence and its applications in physical security | G4S United Kingdom 23 Eloundou et al (2023), Felten et al (2023), Brynjolfsson et al (2023) 24 How automation has affected jobs through the ages | World Economic Forum (weforum.org) 25 AI-and-work-evidence-synthesis.pdf (thebritishacademy.ac.uk)\\\\n\\\\n15\\\\n\\\\n3 Exposure to AI across industries and geography\\\\n\\\\n3.1 Exposure to AI across industry\\\\n\\\\nThe industry estimate of exposure to AI is constructed by taking a weighted average of the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) scores across occupations within an industry.

While some studies suggest a reduction in alcohol consumption among recipients, others indicate temporary spikes in substance consumption with staggered payments. Overall, the impact of UBI on substance use is influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of cash transfers. Additionally, concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco have been unfounded in Low and Middle Income Countries. Further research is needed to understand how the population may respond to UBI in terms of substance use, mental health, and social cohesion.', context=[\"[', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse.

However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial. The aim of this study was therefore to explore whether this change in the conditionality associated with receiving social security benefits had any spillover effects for wider population health in Dauphin, compared with surrounding areas where no such change occurred. In doing so it was identified that...\\\\n\\\\nhospital admissions reduced by 8.5% during the trial in comparison with surrounding local areas.\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Service Utilisation\\\\n\\\\nFew studies have rigorously explored the effects of UBI on mental health service utilisation, and self-reported service use among recipients from cross-sectional surveys have produced conflicting results. In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes. For policymakers in Scotland, where mental health and drug- related hospital admissions continue to soar, on a purely economic level, these findings\\\\n\\\\nHowever, of particular interest is the work of Forget (2011) who used health administration data to examine whether any changes in healthcare utilisation occurred\\\\n\\\\nshould be of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n16.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1 - Hospitalisations per 1000 people by fiscal year.

Rather they were granted to low-income households irrespective of employment status and the only condition applied to one of the study arms was the requirement to engage in a community- based group.\\\\n\\\\nAgain...\\\\n\\\\nIt is worth noting that, as contrasted with UBI pilots in other High-Income Countries, Finland’s Basic Income experiment was statutory and randomised, significantly increasing confidence in their findings. In addition, all of these findings were found to remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic variables, including gender, age, education, household structure and income.\\\\n\\\\nsignificant improvements in wellbeing among all four groups receiving B-MINCOME payments were observed in comparison with the control group who continued to receive standard benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBarcelona’s B-MINCOME study compared traditional welfare benefits, with the effects of four forms of cash payments, namely\", ' (1) cash payments received on an unlimited basis', ' (2) cash payments received on a limited basis (whereby they were incrementally reduced according to any household earnings in excess of the basic threshold)', ' (3) cash payments received unconditionally', ' and (4) cash payments received conditionally on the basis of involvement in a social programme (Kirchner et al. 2019). Although B-MINCOME had a complex study design,\\\\n\\\\nGeneral satisfaction with life, assessed according to a 10-point Likert scale, increased by 27% amongst B-MINCOME groups as a whole, and at the end of the study the probability of participants reporting a ‘high level of life satisfaction’ (rating their wellbeing as ≥ 7/10) was 11% higher amongst those receiving any form of B-MINCOME payment compared with those in the control group (Kirchner et al. 2019). Self-reported experiences of mental illness were also found to be significantly lower (9.6%), although it is not clear from the study reporting exactly how ‘experiences of mental illness’ were enquired about.

Interviews with participants also found that a renewed sense of hope for the future was ubiquitous among recipients (The Young Foundation, 2019', \" 2020).\\\\n\\\\nThe Netherlands Social Assistance Experiments sought to explore whether changes to social security payments could improve employment rates. As such, a sample of participants who were already in receipt of welfare benefits had their payments changed in one of three ways, with a control group who remained on welfare benefits as usual. In one group all conditionality surrounding social security was removed, in a second group increased help and guidance in finding employment was provided and in a third group recipients were allowed to earn extra money before their social security payments were withdrawn (Verlaat et al. 2020). A survey of all groups conducted at the end of the pilot identified positive treatment effects in terms of subjective wellbeing for all three interventions compared to the control group, although these did not reach statistical significance. However, a statistically significant treatment effect on participant’s self- efficacy (defined as a combined measure of self-confidence and perceived ability to find work) was found among both those who had had the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nsurrounding their benefits removed\\\\n\\\\nhad received additional help in finding employment (0.573, p=0.055) (Verlaat et al. 2020). In addition, in interviews, participants in both of these groups consistently reported increased wellbeing and a reduction in stress and anxiety.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ontario Basic Income Pilot (OBIP) was first launched in 2018, with the aim of providing a fixed income for three years to residents of three communities (Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay). Potential participants were those aged 18 to 64 who were living on low or no income, and data was collected from 4000 individuals receiving payments and 2000 control participants (Mendelson, 2019). Although, all of the tenets of UBI were therefore clearly not met, the pilot did provide a guaranteed, unconditional income equivalent to 75% of the Low-Income Measure (Mendelson, 2019).

                  "  - context: [\"[', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse.

However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019). Finally, a qualitative evaluation of MINCOME identified widespread reports of psychological distress as a result of the\\\\n\\\\nSocial Cohesion and Social Participation\\\\n\\\\nperceived social stigma associated with\\\\n\\\\nreceiving traditional welfare benefits.\\\\n\\\\nThis contrasted with the experiences\\\\n\\\\nAccording to proponents, one of the key benefits of UBI is its unique ability to enhance social cohesion through reducing poverty stigma and narrowing the growing\\\\n\\\\nof MINCOME recipients, who reported\\\\n\\\\nincreased social participation and a\\\\n\\\\nlarge reduction in feelings of shame and\\\\n\\\\nstigma due to the avoidance of having\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n19.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\ntheir work and personal lives monitored (The Young Foundation, 2019', \"2020).

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial. The aim of this study was therefore to explore whether this change in the conditionality associated with receiving social security benefits had any spillover effects for wider population health in Dauphin, compared with surrounding areas where no such change occurred. In doing so it was identified that...\\\\n\\\\nhospital admissions reduced by 8.5% during the trial in comparison with surrounding local areas.\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Service Utilisation\\\\n\\\\nFew studies have rigorously explored the effects of UBI on mental health service utilisation, and self-reported service use among recipients from cross-sectional surveys have produced conflicting results. In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes. For policymakers in Scotland, where mental health and drug- related hospital admissions continue to soar, on a purely economic level, these findings\\\\n\\\\nHowever, of particular interest is the work of Forget (2011) who used health administration data to examine whether any changes in healthcare utilisation occurred\\\\n\\\\nshould be of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n16.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1 - Hospitalisations per 1000 people by fiscal year.

Rather they were granted to low-income households irrespective of employment status and the only condition applied to one of the study arms was the requirement to engage in a community- based group.\\\\n\\\\nAgain...\\\\n\\\\nIt is worth noting that, as contrasted with UBI pilots in other High-Income Countries, Finland’s Basic Income experiment was statutory and randomised, significantly increasing confidence in their findings. In addition, all of these findings were found to remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic variables, including gender, age, education, household structure and income.\\\\n\\\\nsignificant improvements in wellbeing among all four groups receiving B-MINCOME payments were observed in comparison with the control group who continued to receive standard benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBarcelona’s B-MINCOME study compared traditional welfare benefits, with the effects of four forms of cash payments, namely\", ' (1) cash payments received on an unlimited basis', ' (2) cash payments received on a limited basis (whereby they were incrementally reduced according to any household earnings in excess of the basic threshold)', ' (3) cash payments received unconditionally', ' and (4) cash payments received conditionally on the basis of involvement in a social programme (Kirchner et al. 2019). Although B-MINCOME had a complex study design,\\\\n\\\\nGeneral satisfaction with life, assessed according to a 10-point Likert scale, increased by 27% amongst B-MINCOME groups as a whole, and at the end of the study the probability of participants reporting a ‘high level of life satisfaction’ (rating their wellbeing as ≥ 7/10) was 11% higher amongst those receiving any form of B-MINCOME payment compared with those in the control group (Kirchner et al. 2019). Self-reported experiences of mental illness were also found to be significantly lower (9.6%), although it is not clear from the study reporting exactly how ‘experiences of mental illness’ were enquired about. In comparison with the\\\\n\\\\nwith various different treatment groups,\\\\n\\\\ncontrol group, the biggest differences\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n10.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nin these outcomes were found amongst those receiving payments in an unlimited fashion and amongst those receiving payments based on their involvement in a social participation programme. Interviews with participants also found that a renewed sense of hope for the future was ubiquitous among recipients (The Young Foundation, 2019', \" 2020).\\\\n\\\\nThe Netherlands Social Assistance Experiments sought to explore whether changes to social security payments could improve employment rates. As such, a sample of participants who were already in receipt of welfare benefits had their payments changed in one of three ways, with a control group who remained on welfare benefits as usual. In one group all conditionality surrounding social security was removed, in a second group increased help and guidance in finding employment was provided and in a third group recipients were allowed to earn extra money before their social security payments were withdrawn (Verlaat et al. 2020). A survey of all groups conducted at the end of the pilot identified positive treatment effects in terms of subjective wellbeing for all three interventions compared to the control group, although these did not reach statistical significance. However, a statistically significant treatment effect on participant’s self- efficacy (defined as a combined measure of self-confidence and perceived ability to find work) was found among both those who had had the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nsurrounding their benefits removed\\\\n\\\\nhad received additional help in finding employment (0.573, p=0.055) (Verlaat et al. 2020). In addition, in interviews, participants in both of these groups consistently reported increased wellbeing and a reduction in stress and anxiety.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ontario Basic Income Pilot (OBIP) was first launched in 2018, with the aim of providing a fixed income for three years to residents of three communities (Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay). Potential participants were those aged 18 to 64 who were living on low or no income, and data was collected from 4000 individuals receiving payments and 2000 control participants (Mendelson, 2019). Although, all of the tenets of UBI were therefore clearly not met, the pilot did provide a guaranteed, unconditional income equivalent to 75% of the Low-Income Measure (Mendelson, 2019).

Research has shown that variations in the value of UBI-like payments can affect childhood obesity rates, especially when payments vary annually with factors such as oil prices. Additionally, UBI-style payments have been linked to positive impacts on health risk behaviors, including dietary habits and substance misuse. The human and economic costs of health risk behaviors are significant. <Doced708774-780c-4374-af7c-e99df3dea0c4>\n",

                  "  - context: [\"[', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

Overall, the impact of UBI on substance use is influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of cash transfers. Additionally, concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco have been unfounded in Low and Middle Income Countries. Further research is needed to understand how the population may respond to UBI in terms of substance use, mental health, and social cohesion.\n",
                  "  - context: [\"[', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019). Finally, a qualitative evaluation of MINCOME identified widespread reports of psychological distress as a result of the\\\\n\\\\nSocial Cohesion and Social Participation\\\\n\\\\nperceived social stigma associated with\\\\n\\\\nreceiving traditional welfare benefits.\\\\n\\\\nThis contrasted with the experiences\\\\n\\\\nAccording to proponents, one of the key benefits of UBI is its unique ability to enhance social cohesion through reducing poverty stigma and narrowing the growing\\\\n\\\\nof MINCOME recipients, who reported\\\\n\\\\nincreased social participation and a\\\\n\\\\nlarge reduction in feelings of shame and\\\\n\\\\nstigma due to the avoidance of having\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n19.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\ntheir work and personal lives monitored (The Young Foundation, 2019', \"2020). Although further methodologically robust studies are warranted, these findings would suggest that minimising the barriers\\\\n\\\\nto accessing social security benefits and reducing', ' particular significance, suggesting these payments accounted for at least some of the observed effect. As such, they suggest that UBI-style interventions introduced in childhood can not only hold immediate benefits for children’s mental health, but can also influence outcomes into adulthood, particularly if introduced early.\\\\n\\\\nMore specifically...\\\\n\\\\nproviding payments in a way which enables rather than prevents parents from spending\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n15.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nquality time with their children are of particular benefit.\\\\n\\\\nSuch findings may be of benefit to policymakers when considering welfare reforms with regard to children’s mental health outcomes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nin Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot of the 1970’s. MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial. The aim of this study was therefore to explore whether this change in the conditionality associated with receiving social security benefits had any spillover effects for wider population health in Dauphin, compared with surrounding areas where no such change occurred. In doing so it was identified that...\\\\n\\\\nhospital admissions reduced by 8.5% during the trial in comparison with surrounding local areas.\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Service Utilisation\\\\n\\\\nFew studies have rigorously explored the effects of UBI on mental health service utilisation, and self-reported service use among recipients from cross-sectional surveys have produced conflicting results. In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes. For policymakers in Scotland, where mental health and drug- related hospital admissions continue to soar, on a purely economic level, these findings\\\\n\\\\nHowever, of particular interest is the work of Forget (2011) who used health administration data to examine whether any changes in healthcare utilisation occurred\\\\n\\\\nshould be of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n16.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1 - Hospitalisations per 1000 people by fiscal year.
