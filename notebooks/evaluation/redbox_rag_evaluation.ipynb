       " '— 16 —\\n\\nBasic Income for All: From Desirability to Feasibility\\n\\nTable 2 outlines the key elements of Model 1. The model could be implemented within the lifetime of a single parliament in one go, phased in possibly over a longer period, or introduced at lower initial rates (see ‘Phasing’, below).\\n\\nTable 2: Elements of a starter rate partial basic income, Model 1 • adult aged 18–64: £60 Weekly payment levels (tax free) • child aged 0–17: £40 • adults 65+: £175 • The first £25 per week of basic income is disregarded for means- testing purposes – so even those receiving means-tested benefits get an income boost. The payment above this disregard is counted as income for the calculation of other benefits. The effect of the disregard is to raise lower net incomes by more than without it, but would lead to less of a reduction (and financial saving) from means- tested benefits. If the whole, or part of the payment was counted as income for means-tested benefits, the net cost would fall and the income gains at the bottom would be lower. Changes to existing benefit system • Child benefit and existing state pension are abolished. • The existing state pension of £164.35 per week is converted into an unconditional flat rate ‘citizens’ pension’ of £175 per week. • Current national insurance contributions (NICs) and the new pen- sion scheme are abolished; eligibility for the state pension would thus become automatic for citizens above the state pension age, rather than conditional on an adequate contributions record as at present, thus raising the income of those with incomplete contribu- tion records, mostly women, and the group most vulnerable to pensioner poverty. • Income tax personal allowance is abolished. • Current higher rate threshold is adjusted upwards so it takes effect at the same existing level of gross income. • A new income tax rate of 15p is introduced for the first £11,850 of taxable income. This is to minimise the number of low income losers. Changes to tax system • Existing income tax rates are raised by 3p taking them in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to 23p, 43p and 48p. • The employee NICs primary threshold is abolished (so NICs are payable on all earnings) and the rate of employee NICs is set at 12% for the whole range of earnings (increasing NICs from 2% to 12% above the upper earnings limit). NICs for the self-employed are also equalised with employees at 12% (currently 9%) as Jobseekers’ Allowance is less important in this system because of the increased working-age basic income rate. • A citizens’ wealth fund is established; this will build over time Creation of Citizens’ wealth fund and start paying out in year 20 under the illustrative Model 2. See Chapter 3. Implementation • The scheme could be implemented in one go or phased in over time in steps. system. First, there is a guaranteed set of payments aimed at providing an income floor.

The payment above this disregard is counted as income for the calculation of other benefits. The effect of the disregard is to raise lower net incomes by more than without it, but would lead to less of a reduction (and financial saving) from means- tested benefits. If the whole, or part of the payment was counted as income for means-tested benefits, the net cost would fall and the income gains at the bottom would be lower. Changes to existing benefit system • Child benefit and existing state pension are abolished. • The existing state pension of £164.35 per week is converted into an unconditional flat rate ‘citizens’ pension’ of £175 per week. • Current national insurance contributions (NICs) and the new pen- sion scheme are abolished; eligibility for the state pension would thus become automatic for citizens above the state pension age, rather than conditional on an adequate contributions record as at present, thus raising the income of those with incomplete contribu- tion records, mostly women, and the group most vulnerable to pensioner poverty. • Income tax personal allowance is abolished. • Current higher rate threshold is adjusted upwards so it takes effect at the same existing level of gross income. • A new income tax rate of 15p is introduced for the first £11,850 of taxable income. This is to minimise the number of low income losers. Changes to tax system • Existing income tax rates are raised by 3p taking them in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to 23p, 43p and 48p. • The employee NICs primary threshold is abolished (so NICs are payable on all earnings) and the rate of employee NICs is set at 12% for the whole range of earnings (increasing NICs from 2% to 12% above the upper earnings limit). NICs for the self-employed are also equalised with employees at 12% (currently 9%) as Jobseekers’ Allowance is less important in this system because of the increased working-age basic income rate. • A citizens’ wealth fund is established; this will build over time Creation of Citizens’ wealth fund and start paying out in year 20 under the illustrative Model 2. See Chapter 3. Implementation • The scheme could be implemented in one go or phased in over time in steps. system. First, there is a guaranteed set of payments aimed at providing an income floor. Secondly, a series of tax adjustments raises the additional income needed to pay for the weekly basic income while making the tax system more progressive. The tax changes involve the abolition of the personal allowance, a new tax rate at the bottom end of the income band of 15p, a rise in existing tax rates of 3p in the pound, and a change in the current system of NICs.

This would apply equally to other reforms of social security aimed at reducing poverty levels. to tackle the great blight of poverty, and the excessive means testing and conditionality of the present system. The plan outlined, one grafted onto the existing system leaving it mostly intact, involves a modest increase in taxa- tion, but lowers the risk of poverty, reduces inequality, boosts the universal element of income support, reduces dependency on means testing, greatly reduces sanctioning, and builds a guaranteed income floor. These are sub- stantial gains. Most of the separate elements that make up a basic income have merit in their own right. Converting the personal tax allowance into a cash payment would be highly progressive. A boost to child benefit, the introduction of a weekly cash payment for young people under 25, the partial correction of the gender bias in the existing system and the income floor would all be important individual measures in any reconstituted anti-poverty programme.
