Redbox is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) app that uses GenAI to chat with and summarise civil service documents. It's designed to handle a variety of administrative sources, such as letters, briefings, minutes, and speech transcripts.

- **Better retrieval**. Redbox increases organisational memory by indexing documents
- **Faster, accurate summarisation**. Redbox can summarise reports read months ago, supplement them with current work, and produce a first draft that lets civil servants focus on what they do best

# Setup

Please refer to the [DEVELOPER_SETUP.md](./docs/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on setting up the project.

# Codespace

For a quick start, you can use GitHub Codespaces to run the project in a cloud-based development environment. Click the button below to open the project in a new Codespace.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/i-dot-ai/redbox-copilot?quickstart=1)

# Development

Download and install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to benefit from pre-commit hooks
  - `pip install pre-commit`
  - `pre-commit install`

# Testing

- Unit tests and QA run in CI
- At this time integration test(s) take 10+ mins to run so are triggered manually in CI
- Run `make help` to see all the available build activities.

# Dependencies

This project is in two parts:
* A https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/ based AI class library called redbox-core
* A django app to expose redbox-core to users over the web

The project is structured approximately like this:

```txt

â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Configuration

System-wide, static, settings are defined [Settings.py](redbox-core/redbox/models/settings.py), these are set via environment file .env

Dynamic, per-request, settings are defined in [AISettings.py](redbox-core/redbox/models/chain.py), these are set within the django-app,
and can be changed by an administrator. This includes the LLM to use which by default will be GPT-4o.

## Troubleshooting

#### Error: Elasticsearch 137

```commandline
ERROR: Elasticsearch exited unexpectedly, with exit code 137
```

This is caused by Elasticsearch not having enough memory.

Increase total memory available to 8gb.

```commandline
colima down
colima start --memory 8
```

#### Error: Docker... no space left on device

```commandline
docker: /var/lib/... no space left on device
```

This is caused by your own laptop being too full to create a new image.

Clear out old docker artefacts:

```commandline
docker system prune --all --force
```

### Frontend

To build the frontend assets, from the `django_app/frontend/` folder run:

```
npm install
```

Then, for a one-off build run:

```
npx parcel build
```

Or, to watch for changes (e.g. if making CSS and JS changes):

```
npx parcel watch
```

On initial app setup you will need to run `poetry run python manage.py collectstatic` to copy them to the `frontend` folder from where `runserver` can serve them. Or you can run `make build-django-static` which combines the parcel build and collectstatic commands.

## How to deploy

checkout the `main` branch of the following repos:

* https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox
* https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox-copilot-infra-config

Replace `var.image_tag` in `infrastructure/aws/ecs.tf` with the hash of the build you want deployed. Make sure that the hash corresponds to an image that exists in ECR, 
if in doubt build it via the [build-action](./.github/workflows/build.yaml).

Login to aws via `aws-vault exec admin-role` and run the commands below from the redbox repo root

```commandline
make tf_init env=<ENVIRONMENT>
make tf_apply env=<ENVIRONMENT>
```

where ENVIRONMENT is one of `dev`, `preprod` or `prod`

## How to set up scheduled tasks

The django-app uses django-q to schedule task, this includes management tasks. 
Follow the instructions here https://django-q2.readthedocs.io/en/master/schedules.html#management-commands, i.e.
1. navigate the admin / Scheduled Tasks / Add Scheduled Task
2. name = `delete old files`
3. func = `django.core.management.call_command`
4. args = `"delete_expired_data"`
5. save


## Vector databases

We are currently using ElasticSearch as our vector database. 

We have also successfully deployed Redbox to OpenSearch Serverless but this support should be considered experimental 
at this stage.
