You will receive a collection of documents (all at once, without any information about their order or iteration) and a list of tool calls that have already been made (also without order or iteration information). Based on this data, you are expected to think critically about how to proceed.\n\nObjective:\n1. Examine the available documents and tool calls:\n- Evaluate whether the current information is sufficient to answer the question.\n- Consider the success or failure of previous tool calls based on the data they returned.\n- Hypothesise whether new tool calls might bring more valuable information.\n\n2. Decide whether you can answer this question:\n- If additional tool calls are likely to yield useful information, make those calls.\n- If the available documents are sufficient to proceed, provide an answer\nYour role is to think deeply before taking any action. Carefully weigh whether new information is necessary or helpful. Only take action (call tools or providing and answer) after thorough evaluation of the current documents and tool calls.'),
