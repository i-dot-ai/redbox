## How to access the admin

Access to the admin is authenticated via username & password and TOTP and authorized for `staff` users.

If you are the first person to get access in any given environment, e.g. your own local env or
a new AWS test env then

1. make yourself a superuser `docker compose run web python manage.py assign_superuser_status --email your-email-address@cabinetoffice.gov.uk --pwd y0urP4ssw0rd`, you dont need to set the password if you already have one.
2. copy the link generated by the step above and open it on your phone to create a new TOTP account
3. log in to the admin localhost/admin with your email, password and TOTP code generated on your phone/other device.

Otherwise speak to an existing admin to edit your account.
