# Streaming AI Response Component

This is a component to handle a streamed response using websockets. It is built using webcomponents so it can be used interchangeably between projects and work with any frontend framework/library.

## How to run

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, within the streaming-ai-response folder, run:
`npm install`

To start server:
`node server.js`

Open the static index.html page in a browser. It's fine to use the file:// protocol, and doesn't need to be served from anywhere.
