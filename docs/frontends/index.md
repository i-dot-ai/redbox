# Frontends

This page lists the frontends that are available for the the Redbox backend.

- [Streamlit](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox-copilot-streamlit) -  A lightweight frontend, ideal for demos and quick prototyping.
- [Django](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox-copilot/tree/main/django_app) - A full-featured frontend, ideal for production deployments.

## Motivations

We decided to have a clear separation between the backend and the frontend. This is because we know that each Government department has different requirements and business logic for the front end. By having a clear separation between the backend and the frontend, we can allow each department to build their own front end that suits their needs.
