# Welcome to Redbox

Redbox is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) app that uses GenAI to chat with and summarise civil service documents. It's designed to handle a variety of administrative sources, such as letters, briefings, minutes, and speech transcripts.

- **Better retrieval**. Redbox increases organisational memory by indexing documents
- **Faster, accurate summarisation**. Redbox can summarise reports read months ago, supplement them with current work, and produce a first draft that lets civil servants focus on what they do best
